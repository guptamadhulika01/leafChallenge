**Import &amp; Visualize the Data**   
Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.    
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.  
Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.    
Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.    

Technolgies used: Python, Pandas, Jupyter notebooks, Leaflet.
